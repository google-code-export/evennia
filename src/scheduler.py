This file contains the event scheduler system.

ADDING AN EVENT:
* Create an event sub-class from the IntervalEvent class in events.py. 
* Call src.scheduler.add_event() with your IntervalEvent subclass as the arg.
* Make sure that the module where your add_event() call resides is either
  imported, or that add_event() is called by a command or some kind of action.
* Profit.
