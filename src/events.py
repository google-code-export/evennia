"""
Holds the global events scheduled in scheduler.py.

Events are sub-classed from IntervalEvent (which is not to be used directly).
Create your sub-class, call src.scheduler.add_event(YourEventClass()) to add
it to the global scheduler.

Use @ps to view the event list.

The events set with the member variable persistent equal to True will be
stored in persistent cache and will survive server downtime.
