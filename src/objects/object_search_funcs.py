    Parse number-identifiers.
    
    Sometimes it can happen that there are several objects in the room
    all with exactly the same key/identifier. Showing dbrefs to
    separate them is not suitable for all types of games since it's
    unique to that object (and e.g. in rp-games the object might not
    want to be identified like that). Instead Evennia allows for
    dbref-free matching by letting the user number which of the
    objects in a multi-match they want.

    Ex for use in game session:

     > look
    You see: ball, ball, ball and ball. 
     > get ball
    There where multiple matches for ball:
        1-ball
        2-ball
        3-ball
        4-ball
     > get 3-ball
     You get the ball. 

    The actual feedback upon multiple matches has to be
    handled by the searching command. The syntax shown above is the
    default.

    For replacing, the method must be named the same and
    take the searchstring as argument and
    return a tuple (int, string) where int is the identifier
    matching which of the results (in order) should be used to
    pick out the right match from the multimatch). Note
    that the engine assumes this number to start with 1 (i.e. not
    zero as in normal Python).
