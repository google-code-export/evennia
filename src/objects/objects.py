"""
This is the basis of the typeclass system. 

The idea is have the object as a normal class with the
database-connection tied to itself through a property.

The instances of all the different object types are all tied to their
own database object stored in the 'dbobj' property.  All attribute
get/set operations are channeled transparently to the database object
as desired. You should normally never have to worry about the database
abstraction, just do everything on the TypeClass object.

That an object is controlled by a player/user is just defined by its
'user' property being set.  This means a user may switch which object
they control by simply linking to a new object's user property.
