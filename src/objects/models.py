"""
This module defines the database models for all in-game objects, that
is, all objects that has an actual existence in-game.

Each database object is 'decorated' with a 'typeclass', a normal
python class that implements all the various logics needed by the game
in question. Objects created of this class transparently communicate
with its related database object for storing all attributes. The
admin should usually not have to deal directly with this database
object layer.

Attributes are separate objects that store values persistently onto
the database object. Like everything else, they can be accessed
transparently through the decorating TypeClass.

    All objects in the game use the ObjectDB model to store

    the typeclass system.

    Note that the base objectdb is very simple, with
    few defined fields. Use attributes to extend your
    type class with new database-stored variables.

    The TypedObject supplies the following (inherited) properties:
      key - main name
      name - alias for key
      typeclass_path - the path to the decorating typeclass
      typeclass - auto-linked typeclass

      locks - lock definitions (handler)
      dbref - #id of object
      db - persistent attribute storage
      ndb - non-persistent attribute storage

    The ObjectDB adds the following properties:
      player - optional connected player
      location - in-game location of object
      home - safety location for object (handler)

      scripts - scripts assigned to object (handler from typeclass)
      cmdset - active cmdset on object (handler from typeclass)
      aliases - aliases for this object (property)
      nicks - nicknames for *other* things in Evennia (handler)
      sessions - sessions connected to this object (see also player)
      has_player - bool if an active player is currently connected
