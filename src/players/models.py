Player

The Player class is a simple extension of the django User model using
the 'profile' system of django. A profile is a model that tack new
fields to the User model without actually editing the User model
(which would mean hacking into django internals which we want to avoid
for future compatability reasons).  The profile, which we call
'Player', is accessed with user.get_profile() by the property 'player'
defined on ObjectDB objects. Since we can customize it, we will try to
abstract as many operations as possible to work on Player rather than
on User.

We use the Player to store a more mud-friendly style of permission
system as well as to allow the admin more flexibility by storing
attributes on the Player.  Within the game we should normally use the
Player manager's methods to create users, since that automatically
adds the profile extension.

The default Django permission system is geared towards web-use, and is
defined on a per-application basis permissions. In django terms,
'src/objects' is one application, 'src/scripts' another, indeed all
folders in /src with a model.py inside them is an application. Django
permissions thus have the form
e.g. 'applicationlabel.permissionstring' and django automatically
defines a set of these for editing each application from its automatic
admin interface. These are still available should you want them.

For most in-game mud-use however, like commands and other things, it
does not make sense to tie permissions to the applications in src/ -
To the user these should all just be considered part of the game
engine. So instead we define our own separate permission system here,
borrowing heavily from the django original, but allowing the
permission string to look however we want, making them unrelated to
the applications.

To make the Player model more flexible for your own game, it can also
persistently store attributes of its own. This is ideal for extra
account info and OOC account configuration variables etc.
