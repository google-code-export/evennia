Command handler

This module contains the infrastructure for accepting commands on the
command line. The process is as follows: 

1) The calling object (caller) inputs a string and triggers the command parsing system.
2) The system checks the state of the caller - loggedin or not
3) If no command string was supplied, we search the merged cmdset for system command CMD_NOINPUT 
   and branches to execute that.  --> Finished
4) Cmdsets are gathered from different sources (in order of dropping priority):     
           channels - all available channel names are auto-created into a cmdset, to allow 
                  for giving the channel name and have the following immediately
                  sent to the channel. The sending is performed by the CMD_CHANNEL
                  system command.
           object cmdsets - all objects at caller's location are scanned for non-empty
                  cmdsets. This includes cmdsets on exits. 
           caller - the caller is searched for its own currently active cmdset.
           player - lastly the cmdsets defined on caller.player are added. 
5) All the gathered cmdsets (if more than one) are merged into one using the cmdset priority rules. 
6) If merged cmdset is empty, raise NoCmdSet exception (this should not happen, at least the
   player should have a default cmdset available at all times). --> Finished 
7) The raw input string is parsed using the parser defined by settings.COMMAND_PARSER. It 
   uses the available commands from the merged cmdset to know which commands to look for and
   returns one or many matches.  
8)   If match list is empty, branch to system command CMD_NOMATCH --> Finished
9)   If match list has more than one element, branch to system command CMD_MULTIMATCH --> Finished
10) A single match was found. If this is a channel-command (i.e. the command name is that of a channel),
    branch to CMD_CHANNEL --> Finished 
11) At this point we have found a normal command. We assign useful variables to it that
    will be available to the command coder at run-time. 
12) We have a unique cmdobject, primed for use. Call all hooks: 
    at_pre_cmd(), cmdobj.parse(), cmdobj.func() and finally at_post_cmd().
