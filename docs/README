       http://code.google.com/p/evennia/wiki/Index
   
   - You can also ask for help from the evennia community,

       #evennia on the Freenode network


* Evennia source auto-docs
  
   In this folder you can build the developer auto-docs 
   (a fancy searchable index of the entire source tree).
   This makes use of doxygen, a doc generator that parses
   the source tree and creates docs on the fly. 
 
   -  Install doxygen (v1.7+)
  
      Doxygen is available for most platforms from
       http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ 
      or through your package manager in Linux.

   -  Run   

       > doxygen Doxyfile
 
      This will create the auto-docs in a folder 'html'. 

   -  Start your web browser and point it to 
      
       <evenniadir>/docs/html/index.html 

   -  If you prefer a pdf version for printing, use LaTeX by
      activating the relevant section in Doxyfile. Run the 
      doxygen command again as above and a new folder 'latex' 
      will be created with the latex sources. With the latex
      processing system installed, then run 
      
       > make 
     
      in the newly created folder to create the pdf. Be warned
      however that the pdf docs are >340 pages long!
   
   -  Doxyfile is lavishly documented and allows for plenty of 
      configuration to get the docs to look the way you want. 
      You can also output to other formats suitable for various
      developer environments, Windows help files etc.
