To create the developer auto-docs, install doxygen (it's available for most platforms here:
 http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ ), and run

> doxygen Doxyfile

in this directory. This will create the auto-docs in ./output/html. To read, point your web browser to 
evennia/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html. If you prefer a pdf / paper hardcopy, install the LaTeX 
system and activate the relevant section in Doxyfile.
