Auto-generated list of default Evennia commands

Commands in Evennia's default command set
=========================================

*Note: This wiki page is auto-generated from the current status of the
code base and should not be edited manually.*

The commands are ordered after their given help category, which should
usually match a module in ``src/commands/default``. So for example, the
code for a command in the "General" category is most likely to be found
in ``src/commands/default/general.py``.

The default `command set <Commands#Command_Sets.html>`_ currently
contains 86 commands in 6 categories. More information about how
commands work can be found in the `Command
documentation <Commands.html>`_.

        than one name. Assign empty to remove all aliases from object.
        Observe that this is not the same thing as aliases 
        created with the 'alias' command! Aliases set with @alias are 
        changing the object in question, making those aliases usable 
        by everyone.

                   deletable in the script file (see example files for
                   syntax). This is useful so as to to not leave multiple
                   object copies behind when testing out the script.    Runs batches of commands from a batch-code text file (*.py).

                  removing any changes that might have been made to the original
                  since it was first created.     Create one or more copies of an object. If you don't supply any targets, one exact copy
        of the original object will be created with the name *_copy.

          copies the coolness attribute (defined on yourself), to attributes
          on Anna and Tom.     Copy the attribute one object to one or more attributes on another object. If
        you don't supply a source object, yourself is used.

          @create[/drop] objname[;alias;alias...][:typeclass], objname...    switch:
           drop - automatically drop the new object into your current location (this is not echoed)
                  this also sets the new object's home to the current location rather than to you.    Creates one or more new objects. If typeclass is given, the object
        is created as a child of this typeclass. The typeclass script is
        assumed to be located under game/gamesrc/types and any further
        directory structure is given in Python notation. So if you have a
        correct typeclass object defined in
        game/gamesrc/types/examples/red_button.py, you could create a new
        object of this type like this:        @create button;red : examples.red_button.RedButton

        switches:
           override - The @destroy command will usually avoid accidentally destroying
                      player objects. This switch overrides this safety.            
        examples:
           @destroy house, roof, door, 44-78
           @destroy 5-10, flower, 45    Destroys one or many objects. If dbrefs are used, a range to delete can be

           @dig house:myrooms.MyHouseTypeclass
           @dig sheer cliff;cliff;sheer = climb up, climb down    This command is a convenient way to build rooms quickly; it creates the new room and you can optionally
        set up exits back and forth between your current room and the new one. You can add as many aliases as you
        like to the name of the room and the exits in question; an example would be 'north;no;n'.

    @home - control an object's home location    Usage:
          @home <obj> [= home_location]    The "home" location is a "safety" location for objects; they
        will be moved there if their current location ceases to exist. All
        objects should always have a home location for this reason. 
        It is also a convenient target of the "home" command.     If no location is given, just view the object's home location.

        Switch:
          twoway - connect two exits. For this to work, BOTH <object>
                   and <target> must be exit objects.     If <object> is an exit, set its destination to <target>. Two-way operation
        instead sets the destination to the *locations* of the respective given
        arguments. 
        The second form (a lone =) sets the destination to None (same as the @unlink command)
        and the third form (without =) just shows the currently set destination.

        Switch:
          del - delete given access type
          view - view lock associated with given access type (default)
        
        If no lockstring is given, shows all locks on
        object.     Lockstring is on the form
           'access_type:[NOT] func1(args)[ AND|OR][ NOT] func2(args) ...]
        Where func1, func2 ... valid lockfuncs with or without arguments. 
        Separator expressions need not be capitalized.    For example: 
           'get: id(25) or perm(Wizards)'
        The 'get' access_type is checked by the get command and will
        an object locked with this string will only be possible to 
        pick up by Wizards or by object with id 25.
        
        You can add several access_types after oneanother by separating
        them by ';', i.e:
           'get:id(25);delete:perm(Builders)'

        Script path can be given from the base location for scripts as given in
        settings. If adding a new script, it will be started automatically (no /start
        switch is needed). Using the /start or /stop switches on an object without

        a previously set attribute while the last form
        inspects the current value of the attribute 
        (if any). You can also set lists [...] and dicts ...

          @tunnel n
          @tunnel n = house;mike's place;green building
        
        This is a simple way to build using pre-defined directions: 
         wn,ne,e,se,s,sw,w,nwn (north, northeast etc)
         wu,dn (up and down) 
         wi,on (in and out)
        The full names (north, in, southwest, etc) will always be put as
        main name for the exit, using the abbreviation as an alias (so an
        exit will always be able to be used with both "north" as well as
        "n" for example). Opposite directions will automatically be
        created back from the new room unless the /oneway switch is given.

          force - change to the typeclass also if the object
                  already has a typeclass of the same name.      
        Example:
          @type button = examples.red_button.RedButton
          
        Sets an object's typeclass. The typeclass must be identified
        by its location using python dot-notation pointing to the correct
        module and class. If no typeclass is given (or a wrong typeclass
        is given), the object will be set to the default typeclass.
        The location of the typeclass module is searched from
        the default typeclass directory, as defined in the server settings.

          @encoding/switches [<encoding>]    Switches:
          clear - clear your custom encoding           
        This sets the text encoding for communicating with Evennia. This is mostly an issue only if 
        you want to use non-ASCII characters (i.e. letters/symbols not found in English). If you see
        that your characters look strange (or you get encoding errors), you should use this command
        to set the server encoding to be the same used in your client program. 
        
        Common encodings are utf-8 (default), latin-1, ISO-8859-1 etc.
        
        If you don't submit an encoding, the current encoding will be displayed instead.

    Switch control to an object
        
        Usage:
          @ic <character>
          
        Go in-character (IC) as a given Character.     This will attempt to "become" a different object assuming you have
        the right to do so.  You cannot become an object that is already
        controlled by another player. In principle <character> can be
        any in-game object as long as you have access right to puppet it.

        to replace strings before sending the command. Give an empty
        right-hand side to clear the nick
          
        Creates a personal nick for some in-game object or
        string. When you enter that string, it will be replaced
        with the alternate string. The switches dictate in what
        situations the nick is checked and substituted. If string
        is None, the alias (if it exists) will be cleared.
        Obs - no objects are actually changed with this command,
        if you want to change the inherent aliases of an object,
        use the @alias command instead.
