Wanna help out? Great! Here's how.

Contributing with Documentation
===============================

Evennia depends heavily on good documentation and we are always looking
for extra eyes and hands to improve it. Even a small thing such as
fixing typos is a great help.

Contributing with Code
======================

Code sharing with Clone repository
----------------------------------

The most elegant way to contribute code to Evennia is to use Mercurial
to create an online *clone* of the Evennia repository and make your
changes to that. .

#. Go to the
   `Checkout <http://code.google.com/p/evennia/source/checkout>`_ page.
#. If you are logged in, you should see a button named *Create a Clone*.
   Click that.
#. You are asked to fill in a few fields. Name your clone repository
   something snazzy. Give a brief summary, like "my repo for messing
   around with Evennia". Accept.
#. Your new repo is created. This is actually your own mini-version of
   the Evennia page! Go to your checkout page and use the command there
   to get a local copy of your clone to your computer.
#. Code away on your computer, fixing bugs or whatnot (you can be
   offline for this). Commit your code to your local clone as you work,
   as often as you like.
#. When you have something you feel is worthwhile (or just want to ask
   people's opinions or make an online backup), *push* your local code
   up to your online repository with Mercurial.
#. Let people know what you did, talk discuss. If you think your changes
   should be merged into main Evennia (maybe you have made bugfixes,
   added new features etc), make a new
   `Issue <http://code.google.com/p/evennia/issues/list>`_ using the
   "Merge Request" template. Try to separate features with different
   commits, so it's possible to pick individual features.

From your online repo, Evennia devs can then, assuming the change is
deemed good, pick and merge your work into Evennia proper.

Patches
-------

It's recommended to use a clone repository as described above. Otherwise
you are also welcome to submit your suggested Evennia fixes/addendums as
`patches <https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Patch_(computing).html>`_
if you like. Depending on what fits best, post your patch to the `issue
tracker <https://code.google.com/p/evennia/issues/list.html>`_ or to the
`discussion
forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/evennia.html>`_. Please
avoid pasting the full patch text directly in your post though, best is
to use a site like `Pastebin <http://pastebin.com/>`_ and just supply
the link.
