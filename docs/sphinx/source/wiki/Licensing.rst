Evennia Licence FAQ
===================

Evennia is licensed under the very friendly *Modified Clarified Artistic
License*. You can find the license as ``LICENCE`` in the Evennia root
directory. You can also read the full license file
`here <http://code.google.com/p/evennia/source/browse/trunk/LICENSE>`_.

You should read the full license file to know what it says exactly, but
here are some answers to common questions.

Q: When creating a game using Evennia, what does the licence permit me
to do with it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** It's your own world to do with as you please! To summarize, a MUD
world you create using Evennia (i.e. the files you create in ``game``)
falls under **ยง6** of the license (it's a sort of "library"). So your
game world and all its contents belongs to you (as it should be). Keep
it to yourself or re-distribute it under any license of your choice - or
sell it and become filthy rich for all we care.

Q: I have modified Evennia itself, what does the license say about that?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** The Evennia package itself (i.e. the stuff you download from us)
is referred to as "The Package, Standard version" in the license.

-  If you just fixed a typo or bug, that falls under **ยง2** - that is,
   you don't *have* to do anything to appease the license. Regardless,
   we'd of course appreciate it if you submitted bugs/fixes to us so
   Evennia becomes more complete!.
-  If you made other modifications or added new features to the server,
   that's also ok, but falls under **ยง3** - you must make a clear note
   of the changes as well as put the changes into the public domain or
   make separate arrangements with us (since it's then no longer a
   "Standard version"). Of course, if you plan to add new features to
   the server, the easiest way to do so is to simply become an Evennia
   developer!

Q: Can I re-distribute Evennia along with my custom game implementation?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** Sure. This is covered in **ยง4** - just package the "Standard
version" (that is, the one you download from us) with your package. Make
sure to include the original license and disclaimers and note where
users may get it if they want to download it of their own.
