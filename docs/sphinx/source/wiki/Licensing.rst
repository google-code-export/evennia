Evennia License FAQ
===================

Evennia is licensed under the very friendly
`BSD <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license>`_ (3-clause) license.
You can find the license as ``LICENSE.txt`` in the Evennia root
directory. You can also read the full license file
`here <http://code.google.com/p/evennia/source/browse/LICENSE.txt>`_
(it's not long).

Q: When creating a game using Evennia, what does the license permit me to do with it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** It's your own game world to do with as you please! Keep it to
yourself or re-distribute it under any license of your choice - or sell
it and become filthy rich for all we care.

Q: I have modified Evennia itself, what does the license say about that?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** The BSD license allows you to do whatever you want with your
modified Evennia, including re-distributing or selling it, as long as
you include our license and copyright info in the ``LICENSE.txt`` file
along with your distribution.

... Of course, if you make bug fixes or add some new snazzy feature we
*softly nudge* you to make those changes available so they can be added
to the core Evennia package for everyone's benefit. The license don't
require you to do it, but that doesn't mean we can't still greatly
appreciate it if you do!

Q: Can I re-distribute the Evennia server package along with my custom game implementation?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** Sure. As long as the text in LICENSE.txt is included.

Q: What about Contributions?
----------------------------

The contributions in ``evennia/contrib`` are considered to be released
under the same license as Evennia itself unless the individual
contributor has specifically defined otherwise.
