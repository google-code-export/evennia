Getting and giving Evennia-help

How to *get* Help
=================

If you cannot find what you are looking for in the `online
documentation <Index.html>`_, here's what to do:

-  If you have trouble with a missing feature or a problem you think is
   a bug, go to the `issue
   tracker <http://code.google.com/p/evennia/issues/list>`_. If you
   can't find the issue already reported, file a new one by filling in
   the handy form.
-  If you need help, want to start a discussion or get input on
   something, make a post in our `forum <http://evennia.com>`_. This is
   technically a 'mailing list', but you don't need to use e-mail; you
   can post and read all messages just as easily from your browser via
   the online interface.
-  If you want more direct discussions with developers and other users,
   consider dropping into our IRC chat channel
   "http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels
   evennia">#evennia on the *Freenode* network. Please note however that
   you have to be patient if you don't get any response immediately; we
   are all in very different time zones and many have busy personal
   lives. So you might have to lurk about for a while - you'll get
   noticed eventually!

How to *give* Help
==================

Evennia is a completely non-funded project. It relies on the time
donated by its users and developers in order to progress.

The first and easiest way you as a user can help us out is by taking
part in `community
discussions <http://groups.google.com/group/evennia/>`_ and by giving
feedback on what is good or bad. Report bugs you find and features you
lack to our `issue
tracker <http://code.google.com/p/evennia/issues/list>`_. Just the
simple act of letting developers know you are out there using their
program is worth a lot.

If you'd like to help develop Evennia more hands-on, here are some ways
to get going:

-  Look through our `online documentation wiki <Index.html>`_ and see if
   you can help improve or expand the documentation (even small things
   like fixing typos!).
-  Send a message to our
   `forum <http://groups.google.com/group/evennia/>`_ and/or our
   "http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels
   evennia">IRC chat asking about what needs doing, along with what your
   interests and skills are.
-  Take a look at our `issue
   tracker <http://code.google.com/p/evennia/issues/list>`_ and see if
   there's something you feel like taking on.
-  Check out the `Contributing <Contributing.html>`_ page on how to
   contribute with code in practice.

In either case, you may find documentation useful to developers in the
`Developer Central <DeveloperCentral.html>`_.
