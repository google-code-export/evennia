About Evennia
-------------
Evennia is a proof-of-concept MU* server that aims to provide a functional
base for developers. While there are quite a few codebases that do the same
(and very well in many cases), we are taking a unique spin on the problem.
Some of our flagship features include (or will one day include):

* Extensive web integration.
* The ability to build/administer through a web browser.
* Shared accounts between the website and the game.
* Optional web-based character creation.
* Extremely easy-to-manipulate SQL database back-end via Django 
  (djangoproject.com)
* Simple and easily extensible design.
* Very granular permissions. Individual and group based.

The essential points here are the web integration and the SQL backing via
Django. The Django framework has database abstraction abilities that give us
many features free, such as:

* The codebase will run transparently on MySQL, SQLite, or Postgres
* At the time of this document's writing, our SQL-backed application here
  contains 0 lines of SQL. Django's database abstraction layer is absolutely
  simple yet very powerful.
* For any model we outline for the server's use, we have the ability to
  more or less automatically generate a web-based admin interface for it with
  two lines of code. This lets you Create, Update, or Delete entries.
* On the web-based side of things, features such as automatic form validation,
  abstraction of sessions and cookies, and access to whatever game data you
  desire are all attractive.
