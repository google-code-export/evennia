The most detailed and up-to-date instructions can always be found at
http://groups.google.com/group/evennia/web/getting-started?hl=en
It is recommended that you refer to there. The instructions below
should be fine, but are terse and may be slightly out of date.

Requirements
------------
* Python 2.5 strongly recommended, although 2.3 or 2.4 may work just fine.
* Twisted -- http://twistedmatrix.com/
* PySqlite2 (If you're using the default SQLite driver)
* Django (Latest trunk from Subversion recommended)
* Optional: Apache2 or equivalent webserver with a Python interpreter
  module. Required for web interface.

Installation
------------
At this point in time, the codebase is changing so rapidly that writing
installation instructions is pretty much pointless. When we get to that stage
in development, we'll make sure to update this. But for the really determined
(or stubborn), here's a rough outline:

* Install Django.
* Get a copy of the Evennia source.
* Optional: Set up your apache2.conf to point mod-python to the settings.py 
  file if you want the web features.
* Change to the evennia/game directory and run something like:
        python manage.py 
  This will create a settings.py file. You may override any of the default
  values in src/config_defaults.py by pasting them into settings.py and
  changing the values.
* If you want to use anything other than the default SQLite setup, copy and
  modify the DATABASE_* variables from src/config_defaults.py.
* Run 'python manage.py syncdb' 
* Run 'python evennia.py -i start'. This will start the MU* server on port 4000
  by default. You may change this via the web interface or by editing the
  config table in SQL.
* Login with the email address and password you provided to the syncdb script.
