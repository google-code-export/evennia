Evennia Installation
--------------------


Pre-Requesites
--------------

As far as operating systems go, any system with Python support should work.

    * Linux/Unix
    * Windows (2000, XP, Vista, Win7)
    * Mac OSX (>=10.5 recommended) 

Of these, only Linux/Unix, Windows XP, and Windows 7 have actually been run by devs and shown to work at this time. Let us know.

You'll need the following packages and minimum versions in order to run Evennia:

    * Python (http://www.python.org)
          o Version 2.5+ strongly recommended, although 2.3 or 2.4 may work. Obs- Python3.x is not supported yet.
          o The default database system SQLite3 only comes as part of Python2.5 and later.
          o Python is available in all modern operating systems (Linux, Mac, etc).
          o Windows users are recommended to use ActivePython (http://www.activestate.com/activepython) 
    * Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com)
          o Version 10.0+
          o Twisted also requires:
                + ZopeInterface 3.0+ (http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface)
                + For Windows only: pywin32 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32) 
    * Django (http://www.djangoproject.com)
          o Version 1.2.1+ or latest subversion trunk highly recommended.
          o PIL library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil) 

To download/update Evennia:

    * Subversion (http://subversion.apache.org)
          o This is needed to download and update Evennia itself.
          o Windows users can use TortoiseSVN (http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org). 

Optional packages:

    * South (http://south.aeracode.org/)
          o Version 0.7+
          o Optional. Used for database migrations. 
    * Apache2 (http://httpd.apache.org)
          o Optional. Most likely you'll not need to bother with this since Evennia 
            runs its own threaded web server based on Twisted. Other equivalent web servers with a Python interpreter 
            module can also be used. 


Installation and Quickstart
---------------------------

* Make sure you have/install the prerequsites listed above. 

* Get a copy of the Evennia source through subversion (SVN):
  
  >  svn checkout http://evennia.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ evennia 

  Once you have downloaded, this is as much internet connectivity you need 
  for trying out Evennia; you don't need to run any web server or to make 
  anything visible online (that's for when you have a game created and
  want people to join it). For now it runs just fine locally on your machine. 

* Change to the evennia/game directory and run
   
  >  python manage.py 
  
  This will create a settings.py file. You may override any of the default
  values in src/config_defaults.py by pasting them into settings.py and
  changing the values. Never edit src/config_defaults.py directly!

* If you want to use anything other than the default SQLite setup, copy and
  modify the database-related variables from src/config_defaults.py.

* Run 
 
  > python manage.py syncdb 

  This sets up the database. Answer 'yes' to create an admin account. Supply 
  a name, e-mail and password when prompted. Remember what you enter since 
  they are used when you log into the server as admin. The name given will 
  be the name of your admin character.

* Run   

  > python evennia.py -i start

  Note: Using -i starts the server in 'interactive mode' - it will print 
  messages to standard output and you can shut it down with (on most systems) 
  Ctrl-C. To start the server as a background process (suitable for production 
  environments), just skip the -i flag. A server running as a process is 
  instead stopped  with 'python evennia.py stop'.

* Start up your MUD client of choice and point it to your server and port 4000.
  If you are just running locally the server name is most likely 'localhost'.

* Alternatively, ou can find the web interface and webclient by
  pointing your web browser to http://localhost:8000.

* Login with the email address and password you provided to the syncdb script.
