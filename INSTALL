Requirements
------------
* Python 2.5 strongly recommended, although 2.3 or 2.4 may work just fine.
* Twisted -- http://twistedmatrix.com/
* PySqlite2 (If you're using the default SQLite driver)
* Django (Latest trunk from Subversion recommended)
* Optional: Apache2 or equivalent webserver with a Python interpreter
  module. Required for web interface.

Installation
------------
At this point in time, the codebase is changing so rapidly that writing
installation instructions is pretty much pointless. When we get to that stage
in development, we'll make sure to update this. But for the really determined
(or stubborn), here's a rough outline:

* Install Django.
* Get a copy of the Evennia source.
* Optional: Set up your apache2.conf to point mod-python to the settings.py 
  file if you want the web features.
* Copy settings.py.dist to settings.py.
* Edit settings.py with your database info.
* Run 'python manage.py syncdb' 
* Run startup.sh. This will start the MU* server on port 4000 by default. You
  may change this via the web interface or by editing the config table in SQL.
* Login with the email address and password you provided to the syncdb script.
