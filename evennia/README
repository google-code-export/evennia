Starting the Server
-------------------
Prior to starting up Evennia, you'll need the following environmental variable
set.

export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="settings"

You may wish to put this in your .bashrc file, or you can simple copy/paste
it before each startup. I'll fix this later so you don't have to, but it'll
do for now.

Once you've got the evar set, simply enter the following:

python server.py

The default port is 4000.
