TODO List
---------
The TODO list has all of the things currently needing attention the most in it.
If you are feeling ambitious, tackle as much as you can and send patches
to the project site or via email to gtaylor@clemson.edu.

High Priority Tasks
-------------------
* Pretty much all of the commands need some kind of required permission(s).
  Right now, pretty much everyone has access to everything. Django has
  a built-in permissions system, it should be trivial to use it for
  the purpose.
* Figure out how to handle our scripting support.

Medium Priority Tasks
---------------------
* We're going to need a delayed event queue in addition to the scheduler.
  For example: I want player X to perform this action in Y seconds.
