TODO List
---------
The TODO list has all of the things currently needing attention the most in it.
If you are feeling ambitious, tackle as much as you can and send patches
to the project site or via email to gtaylor@clemson.edu.

High Priority Tasks
-------------------
* Pretty much all of the commands need some kind of required permission(s).
  Right now, pretty much everyone has access to everything. Django has
  a built-in permissions system, it should be trivial to use it for
  the purpose.
* Figure out how to handle our scripting support.
* Implement @alias. Can probably just use an attribute instead of a new
  object DB field. Shouldn't be too bad. Also needs proper search
  functions in functions_db.py.
* Implement player to player paging/telling.
* Implement a global comsys of some sort. Use MUX2's commands and stuff.

Medium Priority Tasks
---------------------
* We're going to need a delayed event queue in addition to the scheduler.
  For example: I want player X to perform this action in Y seconds.

Low Priority Tasks
------------------
* Write lots of in-game help files.
* Start webbifying the room/thing/exit building process.
