 * Changing server language

 Edit your settings file: 

 USE_I18N = True 
 LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'

Change 'en' to a translated language (see locale/). 
Restart Server and Portal. 


 * Translating

This folder contains translation strings for the core server.

First look in locale/ to see if there are already data files for 
your language available to improve upon. If not, you can
start translate for a new language by placing yourself in 
Evennia's root directory and run 

  django-admin makemessages -l <language code>

where <language code> is the two-letter locale code for the language 
you want, like "sv" for Swedish, "es" for Spanish and so on. Next 
go to locale/<language code>/LC_MESSAGES/and edit the *.po file 
you find there by translating each given English string to the equivalent in 
the other language. Editing the raw file manually is not necessary -- search 
the web and you'll find many open-source graphical .po editors available.
