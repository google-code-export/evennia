Evennia Code Style
------------------
All code submitted or committed to the Evennia project needs to follow the
guidelines outlined in Python PEP 8, which may be found at:

    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
    
A quick list of other stuff
---------------------------
 * 4-space indention, NO TABS!
 * Unix line endings
 * CamelCase is only used for classes, nothing else.
 * All variables and functions are to be lowercase, and words separated by
   underscores.
 * Imports are to be done in this order:
   - Python modules (Global, outside of Evennia)
   - Django
   - Project modules
 
Ask Questions!
--------------
If any of this outlined in PEP 8 or the list above doesn't make sense, please
don't hesitate to ask on the Evennia mailing list at http://evennia.com.
Keeping our code style uniform makes this project much easier for a wider group
of people to participate in.
